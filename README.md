Project 2 
Dianne Etmanski and Ayokunle Oluwole

This repository contains files for the completed Crowdfunding ETL Project. 

The Jupyter Notebook is in the 'Starter Files' Folder. 
It contains code for the 4 dataframes we needed to create. 
Category and Subcategory dataframes were extracted from the crowdfunding.xlsx file and transformed to contain only the category/subcategory id and 
category/subcategory name respectively. 

The campaign dataframe was extracted from the crowdfunding.xlsx file and transformed by first renaming column
